# Day-4-Activities

On Day 4, students will begin to do more python programming and understanding the equivalence between block coding and python programming. Once students have a basic understanding of Python programming with Robomaster (basic concepts like moving the vehicle, moving the gimbal, shooting the laser, detecting markers), students will combine all aspects from the activities they completed earlier to complete a target recognition program that pans and shoots at markers that the robomaster robot detects.
